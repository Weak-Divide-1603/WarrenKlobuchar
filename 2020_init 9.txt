In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread calls for racial and economic justice, voter turnout is expected to break records. Can Warren unite a broad coalition of progressive activists, anti-Trump voters, and working-class Americans to defeat Trump and enact her bold vision for structural reform? Or will Trump, once again trailing in the polls, defy expectations and pull off another upset, securing a second term despite widespread discontent?",

With her message of structural reform, economic justice, and curbing corporate power, Warren steadily gained traction among progressive voters while also appealing to many moderates with her detailed policy plans. Her debate performances and grassroots fundraising impressed the Democratic base, and she successfully built a broad coalition that included young voters, women, and working-class Americans. Warren's victory in key early primaries, such as Iowa and New Hampshire, solidified her momentum, and her relentless campaign organization helped her outlast competitors like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Her ability to unify progressive and more centrist Democrats ultimately propelled her to the nomination, setting up a dramatic face-off against Donald Trump in the general election. </p>",
